# Twitter-Text-Analytics

In this project, I extracted tweets of two people: the president of Ukraine and the president of Russia, to see what terms are most associated with them. ( During the Russia-Ukraine conflict time.) I performed data cleaning, performed string manipulations, and visualized the most frequent terms using word clouds and bar plots. I used R programming language for this project. The codes are available in the TwitterBagOfWords.Rmd file.
